# Looops and Iterations

## Repated Steps
```
n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1
print("Blastoff")
print(n)
```

### How does this work? 

- line 5 assignes 5 to n
- line 6 iniates a while loop as long as n is greater than 0
- line 7 prints current value of n
- line 8 subtracts 1 from the current value of n giving it a new value

this will repeat until n < 0

-line 9 execute when n == 0, printing "Blastoff!"
-line10 will then print n to show its current value of zero letting  
us know that our program ran corrently

#### terminal output should look something like...

```
5
4
3
2
1
Blastoff!
0
```
