## Looking Inside Strings
- index starts at 0, find end using -1

| for | letter | in | 'banana'|
|-----|--------|----|---------|
|loop | iteration variabel| statement | str that we are iterating through|
| tells us what will be performed | tells us how many times we iterate | points us to what we are iterating through | loop will run 6 times index [0:5] |

### String methods

- string.lower() - makes letters lower case, .upper() does the opposite
- string.replace('to replace', 'replace with') - method that accepts something to replace within the string and what to replace it with. Will replace all instances in string
- .lstrip() .rstrip() strip white space from left or right side
- .strip() strips whitespace on right and left
- .startswith(parameter) 



methods are object oriented, class functions are not
