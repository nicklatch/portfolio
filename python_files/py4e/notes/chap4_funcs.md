# Chapter 4, Functions

## Store and reuse steps

### Define the function
```
def func(params):
    definition #(EOF)
```
- def == telling python to "store" the function you are creating
    - when you call defined functon, pything will then take your arguments that were passed into the function and refer back to the **def** and execute the program
- params == a variable we pass to function

#### There are two types of functions:
- Built in functions i.e. print(), input(), float(), ect...
- defined (created) functions, we make these
