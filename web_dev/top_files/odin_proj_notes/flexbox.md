# Flexbox

## Introduction to Flexbox

- Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns
- Items will shrink and grow based on rules stated in class and the window size
- To enable flexbox, put the display: flex; property/value in a respective selector
- Position the box horizontaly using the justify-content: property, with either the flex-start, center, space around, or space-between flex values.
- Items with a set height can use the align-items property to align them vertically. It accepts center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch, and baseline values
- When you rotate the direction of a container, you also rotate the direction of the justify-content property
