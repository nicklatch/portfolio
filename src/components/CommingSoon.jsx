          Hey there, I'm Nick! I'm a fullstack developer. I've spent all of my
          professional life in the trucking industry, starting as a mechanic and
          moving into a techincal support managment role. Now, I am looking to
          move into tech full time! My site is still a work in progress, but
          feel free to poke and around and be sure to check back often!
